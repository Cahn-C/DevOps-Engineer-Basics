## Switches and Routing

List and modify interfaces on the host
```
ip link
```

<br>

To see the ip addresses assigned to a specific interface
```
ip addr
```

<br>

Used to set ip addresses on the interfaces
```
ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
```

<br>

- Note: Changes made using these commands are only valid until a restart, If you want to persist these changes, you must set them in the /etc/network/interfaces file.

Used to view the routing table
```
ip route
```
```
route
```

<br>

Used to add entries into the routing table
```
ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.1
```

<br>

Check if ip forwarding is enabled on a host if you are working with a house that is configured as a router.
```
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

<br>

Reaches out to the DNS server to ensure that we get back a valid ip address
```
nslookup <hostname>
```

<br>

Used to troubleshoot connectivity, reachability, and name resolution
```
ping 192.168.1.0
```

<br>

Troubleshoot an issue with the route, this will show the number of hops or devices between the source
```
traceroute 192.168.1.0
```

<br>

Can be used to print the information of network connections, routing tables and several other network statistics
```
netstat
```

Check if the HTTP process is running on a specific port (in this case, port 80)
```
netstat -an | grep 80 | grep -i LISTEN
```
